<h1>Read Me</h1>
<p>Hello and thank you for reviewing this repository. Below are some of the documents I have authored during my career in IT and other miscellaneous writings. 
Each type of document is divided into a specific area. If there is a link to it, I have included it below the document title. </p>

<h2>Technical Research Papers</h2>

<a href ="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8707429"> Malware Classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks </a>
<p>This was the first document I co-authored while I pursued my undergradate degree at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In it, we examined the viability of converting known malware files to binary images and seeing which is best suited to machine learning.  </p> <br>

Malware Classification using fusion of neural networks</a>
<p>This paper built upon the research of the first paper to utilize GAN and binary images of known malware files to better create an algorithm to identify malicious software. I presented this paper during the 2019 SPIE Commercial Defense + Sensing Conference in Baltimore in 2019. This research also earned recongition at the <a href="https://www.iup.edu/scholars-forum/awards/2019-award-winners.html"> 2019 IUP Scholar's Forum </a> where I received the "S-COAM Best Computational Science Award." </p>
